# PDF_to_Text_Bulk_Conversion
This Python script converts PDF to text for all files in a folder. It truncates content from the "References" section and saves the text as a DOCX file and helps users extract content from PDF documents, eliminate unwanted sections, and save the processed text for analysis or documentation.
